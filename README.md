  - Brief description of what was done
    This project involves a sales data analysis for a fictional commercial store using a structured retail dataset. The goal was to extract actionable business insights 
    through data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization.
    Using Microsoft Excel for initial exploration and Power BI (with Power Query, DAX, and data modeling), I created an interactive dashboard highlighting key sales 
    metrics, customer demographics, top-performing managers, product categories, and city-wise sales.
    This project was completed as part of Task 1 during my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions, demonstrating my skills in retail analytics and data visualization.
